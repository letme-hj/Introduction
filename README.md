# About Me

Hi, I'm Haeji Jung, a graduate of **Korea University** with **B.A. in Korean Language and Literature** and **M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering**.<br>
I am currently a visiting scholar in **Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University**, doing a research on **multilingual language models**, particularly **cross-lingual representations**.<br>
Before delving into multilingual language models, I liked to explore practical scenarios using **multimodal approaches** that involve textual representations.<br>

Please check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u6h3GN9aWfHR-KlH-lKlpIjrN3hUYt6h/view?usp=sharing) to find more!<br>
